Believe born under Ruidus good 
A section of the cult has infiltrated the upper echelons of the [[Consortium of the Vermilion Dream]] in order to weaponise [[Ruidium]], incorrectly assuming it is related to Ruidus. They run a test in [[Bazzoxan]] within [[Betrayer's Rise]] which causes an explosion and a breach.

###### AKA Razz

#### Current Situation 
> Growing up as a Drow in the [[Empire]], Razz was put forward to represent the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul]] and [[Empire]]'s interest in the [[Ruidium]] research. Lifelong friend to [[-Natsumi]] and has since learned of [[Consecution]], realising it's happening to Natsumi without her knowledge. 

#### Appearance
- Drow 
- they/them, masculine leaning
- 

#### Vocalisation

- Undefined.

#### Notes
- unknowingly feeding information to [[content/1netherdeep/Characters/Empire/Trent Ikithon|Trent Ikithon]] 
- they were shipping off from [[Rexxentrum]] to represent empire interest in Ruidium
- Drinking buddies with [[-Natsumi]]:
	- they play dragon chess together, are also a dog person, they visit [[-Natsumi]] and their dogs hang out
	- grew up poor, but "made it" in different ways that required sacrifice, so they can relate to each other about that experience
	- there's no pressure, and they can pick up where they left off with no issue. 
	- they show up out of the blue after months like, "Natsumi, I need your big brain for somethin," and they crack a cobalt soul problem together
	- Natsumi feels she can trust this person even though she seems to be losing her mind, cus their friendship has always been kind of weird

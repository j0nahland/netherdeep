###### AKA Sunny

#### Current Situation 
> Posing as a solo researcher searching for a cure for his affliction. Seen to be working with the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul]] and [[Allegiance of Allsight]]. Bookish telepath who doesn't realise he is being manipulated by [[Aradrine the Owl]] and the [[Children of Ruidus]]. Hasn't seen [[-Tillie]] since early adulthood. 

#### Appearance
- Gnome who covers his chest and face due to heavy scarring
- Piercing crimson eyes - a sign of [[Ruidus]] Lycanthropy
- Carries no magical focus or weapon due to psychic ability

#### Vocalisation
- Unsure, potentially American answering machine.
- Gravelly when speaking with physical mouth

#### Notes
- Kind of a bad guy but can go either way, ideally depending on what the party does. 
- Has a wound from when he contracted Lycanthropy that is similar to [[-Karzepp]]'s in that it is corrupting him, and the source of psychic abilities. 
- From here I'm thinking that it's actually really difficult for him to communicate and as such a characteristic is that he speaks in short sentences. 
- He's a somewhat mysterious organiser for the rivals, a leader by virtue of him being the researcher who organised the trip to [[Jigow]].

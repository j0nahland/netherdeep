Yusaf is a nice enough person but not a confidant. He will often remind you to avoid the Vermilion Dream but it's unclear if that's best for you as a person or him as a researcher - time will tell. He is the only real lead you have and eagerly awaits the research team's return so he can go over their findings. By sending you to them he hopes you will learn something sooner than staying in Bazzoxan

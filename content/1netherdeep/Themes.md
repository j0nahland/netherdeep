Can you ever make the truly right decision

Dysphoria
- Identity
- body

Corruption
- Rage
- Despair
- Regret
- Yearning

Cycle of life
- When is the right time to die
- Family bonds

Ruidus 
- **Harbinger**. Those who are born on a night when Ruidus is full are destined to bring suffering to others or to experience great tragedy in their own lives.
- **Malice**. Those who study Ruidus and become obsessed with its secrets are compelled to cause misfortune and woe.
- **Misadventure**. Plans made or set in motion when Ruidus is full are doomed to failure, often due to betrayal or miscommunication

regret I think is Kristy (her poor relationships with family) , yearning is Sydney (for her mum and a cure) and Despair is a fit for Gemma (not only did she lose her family in her current life, she has to realise she has lost her empire and her past lover) which leaves Rage for Travis, or we could identify something else and make it a theme too

I think the opportunity here is to is to try tempt each character deeper into their emotion and reward them with corruption/more power. Each one could become a 'champion' of that emotion. If they don't take the opportunity their rivals will - so there's a sense of urgency.
